# Udacity React Native Mobile Flash Cards

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks

git clone https://github.com/kushalraghavpoojari/udacity-react-mobile-flashcards.git
